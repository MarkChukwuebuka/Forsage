			<h3 class="text-center text-truncate">About Forsage</h3>
			<p>Forsage is an affliate marketing or you can call it Network marketing. In Forsage, the possibility of earning thousands of dollars is high. When we say affiliate marketing that means when you join you are to bring referrals and in Forsage you are expected to bring only 3 people to start earning. It's legit and you can make a lot and its just $17 to join. But because we know to get people is difficult, we came up with this team.
			When you join you dont have to be going around looking for people alone. We do it together as a team, when one person gets his or her 3, we move to the next person on the list, and when that person gets his or ger 3, we move to the next.
			So it goes on like that for life. </p>

			<h3 class="text-center">How to Earn</h3>
			<p>You earn ethereum on forsage through 3 main ways:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Spillovers</li>
				<li>Overflows</li>
				<li>Referrals</li>
			</ol>
			<p>And the higher you grow the more mad your profit increases because there are different levels in the project.</p>
			<p>Lets explain the various ways for better understanding</p>
			<h5 class="text-center">Spillovers</h5>
			<p>Spillover works in a such a way you earn from your uplines and people connected to you on the system irrespective of their location, it could be Lagos, London, Spain, India, USA, Russia, Asia or any other place in the world. The platform gives you the privilege to get massive spillovers from all its members.</p>
			<p>Spillover can fall on you from anywhere, so the amount of ethereum you earn based on spillovers varies. It is not fixed.</p>

			<h5  class="text-center">Overflows</h5>
			<p>Overflow: This happens when your upline earns to the extent his basket get filled, all other earnings will start falling on you whether you refer or not. While spillover gives you indirect referrals and dollars, overflow gives you only $$.</p>
			<p>Overflow gives you basket of dollars and that is why you need to join our hot TEAM in order to fall under a very hot upline. 
			Trust me you can make money from forsage without referring, and that is through overflows and spillovers.</p>

			<h5 class="text-center">Referals</h5>
			<p>On forsage, you can refer in order to triple your earnings. You already know what REFERRING is.</p>
			

			<p> Now, the good thing about cryptocurrency is that the company doesn't house your money, you are totally incharge so there is no scam here... All your ethereum will be stored in your trust wallet and only u has access to it..
			You can either accumulate it or sell it off..(it is a decentralized earning system, you have sole access to your profits)</p>

			<p>Even if FORSAGE closes like how diamond bank closed, you still have your cryptocurrency intact. So, have no fear of it crashing, the crypto market never crashes.</p>

			<h4 class="text-center">QUICK ELABORATION ON HOW FORSAGE WORKS</h4>

			<p>Forsage has two parts that work together. You earn from both parts when you register. Whether you refer or not. </p>

			<h5 class="text-center">THE AFFILIATE PART</h5>
			<p>THE FORSAGE X3 : You earn on this part when you refer new members.</p>


			<p>Forsage provides another alternative means to earn if you aren't a fan of referring.. Which is forsage X4 ( I will explain that in next post)</p>

			<h5  class="text-center">THE NON AFFILIATE PART</h5> 
			<p>THE FORSAGE X4 : you earn on this part even if you don't refer. It is made to favour those that can't refer. This is where you get your profit just for being a member of the system.</p>

			<h5 class="text-center">How you earn on Forsage without referring.</h5>

			<p>The system provide two ways for members to enjoy profit on the system via</p>
			<ul>
				<li>spillover : bonuses from uplines and downlines that have gotten enough profit and refusing to upgrade or open another level.. The system distribute this bonuses to X4 group.</li>
				<li>Overflow : bonuses from your upliner when all his slots are full the remaining bonus goes down to his downlines.. This is a means the system use to reward those that can't refer from there uplines effort for referring.</li>
			</ul>

			 


			<p>That's is why the team you join is important it will speed up your spillover benefits and overflow bonuses</p>

			<p>FORSAGE is not a ponzi scheme that pays you based on the number of refferals you have. .. The basic truth is that you can have  50refferals on forsage and earn roughly $200 from forsage....  But you can have just 3 refferals and have more than $750 ..Ask me how?? </p>


			<p>Now forsage requires a team work and not individual work.. You grow and earn from both your upline, your downline and even earn from your downline downline and so on..</p>
			<p>We're not depending on your referral because if you don't work it affects us and we don't want it to be so, so just join and we'll keep getting people ourselves and all you do is sit back and earn.</p>
